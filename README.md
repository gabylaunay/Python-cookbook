# Python-cookbook
A Python cookbook for scientific data analysis.

This is a work in progress, mainly oriented towards image analysis at the moment.

## How to access it

Those ressources are accessible as a static [website](https://gabylaunay.github.io/Python-cookbook).

If you want to play with the code, this is also available as an interactive [jupyter notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gabylaunay/Python-cookbook/master?urlpath=lab/tree/src/notebooks/pydsa.ipynb).
