From wikipedia: 
Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for
general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and
first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that
emphasizes code readability, and a syntax that allows programmers
to express concepts in fewer lines of code,[25][26]
notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that
enable clear programming on both small and large scales.[27]
